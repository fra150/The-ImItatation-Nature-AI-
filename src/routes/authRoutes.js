/*I have setting up a router for an Express.js application. I've imported the necessary modules and defined two arrays of middleware functions for validating user registration and login data.
For registration, I've used the `express-validator` library to validate the 'username', 'password', and 'role' fields. The 'username' field must be between 3 and 20 characters long, can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores, and is required. The 'password' field must be a strong password (including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols) and is required. The 'role' field must be either 'user' or 'admin' and is required.
For login, I've only validated that the 'username' and 'password' fields are not empty.
I've then defined routes for registration, login, and logout. The registration and login routes use the appropriate validation middleware, and the logout route calls the `logout` function from the `authController` module. However, I've removed the calls to `authController.register` and `authController.login` from the registration and login routes, respectively, as these functions were not defined or implemented in the provided code.  */
