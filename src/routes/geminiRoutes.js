/* In this code, I'm dreaded up a route for a web application using the Express.js framework. The route is a POST request to the root URL ('/'). When a POST request is made to this URL, the `getDataAndProcess` function from the `GeminiController` module will be called to handle the request.
Firstly, I'm importing the necessary modules. `express` is the Express.js framework, which is used to create web applications and APIs. `GeminiController` is a custom module that contains the logic for handling the POST request.
Then, I'm creating an instance of an Express router using `express.Router()`. A router in Express.js is a middleware that can handle HTTP requests.
I'm defining a route on the router using `router.post('/', GeminiController.getDataAndProcess)`. This route will listen for POST requests to the root URL ('/') and call the `getDataAndProcess` function from the `GeminiController` module to handle the request.
Finally, I'm exporting the router so that it can be used by other parts of the application. This allows the application to handle POST requests to the root URL and call the `getDataAndProcess` function to process the data. */
